# Code assessment

## Instructions

This repository is a simple project that has a Spring backend and a React frontend.
The interface contains a patient profile with some information about the patient.

Your task will be to add a new feature to the project.
The goal is to add a search field to the patient profile page that allows to indicate that a patient has an allergy to a
given molecule.

This should work as follows:

1. The user clicks on the search field and search for a molecule
2. The user selects the molecule from the list of results
3. The user clicks on the "Add" button to add the molecule to the patient's allergy list

The provided code is not representative of the expectations we have for production code (on purpose).
We instead encourage you to build the feature in a way that you think is the best using the current organization or something else.
We **don't** expect you to fix the current code though, just to add the new feature.
Listing what you would change in the `Improvements section` is enough and **will be considered in the evaluation**.
